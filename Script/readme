This folder contains useful scripts for constructing a defect genome to model extensive defects in metals using empirical interatomic potential-guided active learning (EIP-AL) and periodic configuration construction via grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (PCC-GCMC).
1. Run molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using empirical potentials to obtain snapshots containing diverse large-scale defects.
2. Run MD simulations with MLIP-3 without active learning to select all defects.
3. Select representative structures: Execute mpirun -np 1 /scratch1/08271/fshuang/Tools/mlip-3/bin/mlp select_add curr.almtp train.cfg preselected.cfg selected.cfg.
4. Generate representative defect clusters: Execute mpirun -np 1 /scratch1/08271/fshuang/Tools/mlip-3/bin/mlp cut_extrapolative_nbh selected.cfg nbh.cfg --cutoff=8 --no_save_additional_atoms.
5. Perform PCC-GCMC by running fill_gcmc.in.
